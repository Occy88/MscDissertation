%what am I writing about and what is it's usefullnes/point of it.

Automated planning has been a topic of research since the 1960s. It came into fruition due to the desirability of accomplishing tasks autonomously, which is a problem in almost all activity-based domains. Tasks are solved by an ordered set of actions over a domain. The job of formally defining actions, their conditions and effects, becomes increasingly difficult and prone to error as domains evolve to be ever more complex. For such reasons, in recent years, researchers have leveraged progress in Machine and Deep learning to automate the generation of action models from synthetic and real-world data. Machine learning a deep learning techniques are evolving at an increasingly fast rate, whilst there has been no clear translation layer between action models and common learning libraries. Combined with the multitude of existing domain languages, This issue has manifested itself as lack of testing and use-able implementations of current reconstruction approaches.

% Summary of what was done in this Disertation
This dissertations provides an overview of the current state of the art in reconstruction of action models, discusses core issues that have affected rapid development and implementation of more powerful reconstruction techniques available today, and proposes a framework standardising future development of  action-model reconstruction models. A proof of concept framework is then tested with an existing learning model using Markov Logic Networks, finally we compare results. 

% Summary of results/observations.
We have found that the proposed framework can work in the simulated scenario and provides a good foundation for more complex learning model implementations. Being based in python is highly modular and provides possible integration with all modern learning techniques. This framework also lowers the entry barrier for new researchers in the field as there is no longer a need to question language format or how to implement it as most existing languages can be supported over time.
